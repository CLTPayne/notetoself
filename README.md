3. When finished with the application, close the server with ```^c```

#### Run Tests:

2. Test coverage of 83%.

#### Application Purpose:
A simple note app which allows the user to store a list of text strings as reminders, via browser cookies. When reminders are complete the user can clear the whole list in one go.

#### Project Goals:
1. Explore React components
2. Learn ES6 and understand why it is so useful in react (anonymous functions like the fat arrow function do not create their own this object and so they are very useful for setting state in the correct context of a component)
3. Explore testing of react components

#### Build Process:
1. Application was created with ```create-react-app```
2. Used ```sfcookies``` module for local storage so that the notes persist
3. React bootstrap was used for simple form elements
4. CSS for basic styling
